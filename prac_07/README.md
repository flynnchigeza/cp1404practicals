## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
Throughout this subject, I’ve learned several important principles for writing clean, maintainable code:

- **Small, Focused Functions:** Write short functions that do one thing well, making them easier to test and debug.  
- **Consistent Style and Formatting:** Follow PEP8 conventions and use tools like “Reformat Code” to ensure consistency across the project.  
- **Use of Constants and Avoiding Magic Numbers:** Improves readability and makes programs easier to modify.  
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep logic, input/output, and data separate for modular and reusable code.
